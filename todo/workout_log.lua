today felt like a great workout, but I need to take a rest day tomorrow. Because
that is something that I never fucking do otherwise

tomorrow I take a rest day. and then on friday it is press day. which is a
very nice day to do. all of the exercises are super easy. I just have to do it.
then on saturday it's leg day again. I am really looking forward to this day
again. because last time I started doing bulgarian split squats and it feels
very nice. I will continue doing bulgarians with body weight for a while and
see where it takes me. doing eights on each leg as always.

I did back workout today. this includes 5 types of muscles.

1. LOWER BACK
  at the moment I am doing jefferson curls and back extensions here.
  over. time I will do more dead lifts here. as I feel more confident in my
  back.

2. OVER HEAD PULLS
  this one is just pulling and working with over head flexibility. I just have
  to continue working here. Because here I am progressing plus that I am starting
  to be able to hone in more and more on my muscles in the shoulder blade here.

3. LATS
  i am curious to see how I feel next time. today I felt a little bit stronger
  than the last couple of days so I hope that I will at least feel some soreness
  tomorrow. I think that I have gotten a little stronger. we'll see next time.

4. REAR DELTS
  i have gotten stronger in my rear delts for sure. and it feels great doing this
  exercise. i am just going to continue working here and see where it takes me.

5. TRAPS
  traps are still a little bit uncomfortable to do. but I think that one issue
  here is that I just need to get the movement dialed in.
