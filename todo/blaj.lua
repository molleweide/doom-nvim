-- cluster sets.
-- some multi joint movements and three to five repetitions each.
--

-- NOTE:
-- today I am going to do a light leg pull workout. because doing everything in
-- a split like this really does allow for better focus. otherwise there is just
-- to low volume per session which I can feel i think, and so what I do now is
-- 5 day rolling schedule doing upper back, upper press, legs, arms, and leg pull.


-- TEST:
-- now i have to read through the server code and explore each package and
-- learn what everything does. this is very important.
-- i will be going hard an really trying to do high reps on each dimension.
-- i am going to do a circle training on lats and rear delts vs oh pulls,
-- and then also inject jefferson curls. it is goig to be a very nice
-- session. and I am truly longing for the feel after it to see how I feel
-- after having done a lot of jeffies.

-- nu saohaer efterhand sao it feels good. it seems that I just have to fucking
-- bring the shit out and make it so that it takes fucking time and i have to
-- do a lot of low weight reps. it sucks that the four kilo gram weights arent
-- there because it is so hard to get a good weight otherwise.
--
-- but my chest is progressing. i like doing high reps and i could probably
-- do lower weights around twenty and just do tens at that weight.
--
-- next time i shall do more flies training and make sure to go low weight and
-- high reps and just pump the chest and make it adapted to the stimuli.
--
-- serratus always feels uncomfortable but i will keep doing it since it is
-- a movement dimension that has to be considered.
--
-- shoulders require a lot of focus, and i should really do high reps when
-- it comes to my shoulders and. the nippard tip about pulling the cable
-- between the legs is genius. i had never thought about that and it really
-- makes sense.
