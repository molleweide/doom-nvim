-- so this actually means that I can somehow actually come up with perfect
-- midi source groups and so this is how it is
-- being done and you shouldnt really actually do shit on these with the
-- mouse. you navigate with the keys and then you just tell the program where
-- you want shit and that is how it should all work an the groups are
-- dynamically created as you make more tracks you know so this becomes like
-- a master group way of editing your tracks in a pretty sweet way.
